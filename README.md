# FinalProject-Cybersafe

Higher Diploma in Science in Computing Cybersecurity - National College of Ireland.

The goal of CyberSafe is to improve the adoption of cybersecure behaviours and best
practices across the National College of Ireland community, regardless of field of study.
CyberSafe is a project led by students, and aims to address one of the top concerns
when we are near completion of our academic education: the lack of practical or “real
world” experience when facing the job market, especially in the case of technical
disciples, such as Computer Science. CyberSafe will create opportunities for
cybersecurity students to become proactive contributors to the safety of the
university’s environment, as well as to apply their knowledge by acting as cybersecurity
consultants or advisors in other students’ projects.
CyberSafe is a social portal that aims to become NCI’s cybersecurity learning hub, the
members of this web application will have the chance to read about cybersecurity best
practices, connect with other members in the community, and request advice from
cybersecurity experts to implement security in their projects, assignments and day-today activities.
CyberSafe will be an opportunity for cybersecurity students to have an impact on the
NCI community and put the knowledge and skills acquired through academic training
into practice.
The objective of the CyberSafe project is to:
1. Apply the knowledge acquired through the H.Dip. in Science in Computing –
Cybersecurity in the development of a cybersecurity-focused social network.
2. Implement cybersecurity principles and features learnt through this degree to
build a safe application.
3. Deliver a functional prototype of CyberSafe that showcases its main features.
